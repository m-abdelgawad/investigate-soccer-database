* The database is stored in an SQLite database, and I accessed its files using the 'DB Browser(SQLite)' software.

* Some column titles were self-explanatory, while others I had to look up on Kaggle.

* What teams improved the most over time?
* Which players had the most penalties?
* Statistics of Players' Age
